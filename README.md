<h2>Memory FlipCard Game</h2>

I made a responsive social flip card memory game by following @AsmrProg tutorial as a process of learning JavaScript. In this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I added shake effects to the game. When the cards are wrong, it makes a shake. I also added time and flips count to the game. When you flip a card, it gains flip. If the time is over, you need to restart game.
